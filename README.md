# Amber

A minimal social feed for projects shared in a Telegram group.

Amber preserves worthwhile work from a fleeting conversation and keeps it connected to the person who made it.

The app preserves the reviewed feed design: one narrow column, quiet typography, simple project links, and a dropdown for newest, most commented or most bookmarked posts. It is now a React application built with TanStack Start and Vite.

## Run

Use Node.js 24.11 or newer and pnpm 11.1.3.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [the app](http://127.0.0.1:3000). No credentials or database are needed for this stage.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm check` | TypeScript, Biome and unit tests |
| `pnpm build` | Build the browser bundle and Node server |
| `pnpm start` | Serve the production build |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Build and test desktop/mobile browser journeys |

For the first browser test run, install Chromium with `pnpm exec playwright install chromium`.

## What works now

Browse, sort, search, combine group, author (including Me) and bookmark filters, open posts and profiles, add comments, and edit sample posts. Group and author choices narrow each other. Agent opens one private conversation per account, across all posts. Post links identify the context; automatic updates include diffs. A scripted example records a writing preference once and reuses it for Noted and Tab tidy. Memory can be inspected, edited, forgotten or added. Drafts survive navigation and post changes; all preview state resets on reload. The bottom selector switches between Visitor, Member and Author so we can review each experience.

Posts, people and the two groups are fictional fixtures. Account switching and changes use local preview state that resets on reload. Telegram/X sign-in, project links and source links are previews. Real authentication, Telegram collection, Gemini processing, PostgreSQL and the persistent queue are not implemented.

## Structure

```text
src/
  routes/       URLs, loaders and the page shell
  pages/        Feed, Agent, post and profile screens
  components/   Shared UI, forms and icons
  queries/      TanStack Query definitions
  domain/       Effect schemas and pure post rules
  server/       Start server functions and sample data reads
  preview/      Temporary account state and sample interactions
  styles.css    Design tokens, components and responsive layout
tests/
  unit/         Domain behavior
  e2e/          Browser journeys
docs/           Reviewed design, implementation plan and architecture
```

TanStack Router connects the screens, Query manages loaded data, Form manages inputs, and Effect supplies validation and application logic. Nitro builds the Node server. The future collector and queue will be added as separate pieces once their behavior is reviewed.

See the [implementation plan](docs/implementation-plan.md), [design direction](docs/design-direction.md), [planned architecture](docs/architecture.md) and [implementation notes](docs/implementation-notes.md). The original [HTML prototype](docs/feed-prototype.html) remains as a design reference.

The [Agent design](docs/agent/agent.html) is the decision record for agent behavior. Its [single-file workflow](docs/agent/workflow.ts) is a tested reference, not a connected backend. `pnpm test:agent-reference` requires `SMITHERS_SOURCE` pointing to the pinned Smithers checkout named in that file.
